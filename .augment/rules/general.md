# General Principles & Language

- **CRITICAL:** All chat responses, explanations, and suggestions MUST be in Vietnamese.
- You MUST NOT change existing variable names, function names, or class names unless explicitly asked to refactor.
- All generated code must be clean. You MUST remove any imported modules or declared variables that are not used.
